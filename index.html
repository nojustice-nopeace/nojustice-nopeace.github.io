	<h1>Welcome to the BLM Hashtag Generator.</h1>
	<p>
		Social media has recently been actively working to suppress
		videos, posts, and images of the ongoing struggle for civil rights
		in America. This is completely unacceptable. One major way they are doing this
		is by the suppressing of consistent hashtags. "Trending" only counts topics that
		experience surges activity, but <b>not</b> consistent numbers (such as #BlackLivesMatter).
		However, together we can solve this problem. Each day, 3 new hashtags will
		appear here. By cycling hashtags, we can make the current movement unavoidable.
		There will be no consistency to the tags, so surges will happen each day on these, causing
		the media from this movement to permanently appear to be trending. These hashtags
		should be used across <b>all</b> social media to bring as much attention as possible.
